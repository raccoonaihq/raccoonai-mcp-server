Raccoon AI's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables leveraging the LAM API for web browsing, data extraction, and complex web tasks automation.

## What can you do with this?

- Search and browse websites
- Fill out forms and navigate UI elements
- Extract structured data based on defined schemas
- Handle multistep processes across websites

## Prerequisites

Before using the Raccoon LAM MCP server, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or another MCP-compatible client
- Raccoon AI Secret Key and your Raccoon Passcode

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raccoonaihq/raccoonai-mcp-server.git
```
```bash
cd raccoonai-mcp-server
```
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

### To configure in Claude Desktop

```bash
mcp install src/raccoonai_mcp_server/server.py -v RACCOON_SECRET_KEY=<RACCOON_SECRET_KEY> -v RACCOON_PASSCODE=<RACCOON_PASSCODE>
```

Replace `<RACCOON_SECRET_KEY>` and `<RACCOON_PASSCODE>` with your actual creds. You can find them [here](https://platform.flyingraccoon.tech).
